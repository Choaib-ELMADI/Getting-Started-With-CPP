1. Searching Algorithms:
    Searching algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure 
    where it is stored.
    Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are classified into two categories:
        > Sequential Search: traverse the list or the array element by element.
        EXAMPLE ==> Linear Search
        <=> Time complexity of a linear search algorithm : O(n) => 'n' is the number of elements in the collection. 
            This means that the time taken to perform the search increases linearly with the size of the collection.
        <=> Space complexity of a linear search algorithm: O(1) => which means it uses a constant amount of additional 
            memory regardless of the size of the collection.

        > Interval Search: designed for searching in sorted data structures. They target the center of the search
        structure and divide search space in a half.
        EXAMPLE ==> Binary Search
        <=> Time complexity of a binary search algorithm : O(log n) => 'n' is the number of elements in the collection.
        <=> Space complexity of a binary search algorithm: O(1) => which means it uses a constant amount of memory.
