1. Sorting Algorithms:
    Sorting algorithms are designed to sort the given data structure.
    EXAMPLE ==> Insertion Sort: 
        > Each time we get a new element, we put it in the its right spot.
        > We always shift greater element to the right (NO SWAPPING).
        <=> Time complexity of an insertion sort algorithm : O(nÂ²) => 'n' is the number of elements in the collection.
            O(n) for iterating & O(n) for shifting (Worst Case)
            O(n) for iterating & O(1) for shifting (Best Case)
        <=> Space complexity of an insertion sort algorithm: O(1) => which means it uses a constant amount of additional 
            memory regardless of the size of the collection.
