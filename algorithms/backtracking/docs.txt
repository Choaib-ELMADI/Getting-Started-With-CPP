1. Backtracking:
    * Backtracking algorithm follows the brute force approach and DFS.
    -> Brute force approach: For any given problem, try all the possible solutions and pick up desired ones.
    -> Backtracking is used when you have multiple solutions and you want all of them.
    -> Following brute force approach, we generate a state space tree.

2. Branch & Bound:
    * Branch & Bound algorithm follows the brute force approach and BFS.
