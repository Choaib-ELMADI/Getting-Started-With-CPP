1. Graph Traversal:
    Starting from a single vertex, visit all the vertices of a graph.
    (Difference in the order of visiting vertices)
    EXAMPLE ==> Depth First Search (DFS)
    DFS: Explore new vertices until we hit a dead end then we take a step back.

2. Tree Traversal:
    Depth First Search   (DFS): prioritizes the depth over the width (element by element vertically)
    Breadth First Search (BFS): prioritizes the width over the depth (layer by layer horizontally)

    DFS Types:
        > preorder ==> (Data, Left, Right)
        > inorder  ==> (Left, Data, Right)
        > postorder => (Left, Right, Data)
