1. Trees:
    - EXAMPLE:
        > Family Trees
        > Folders structure

    - A tree consists of nodes
    - Nodes are connected together with edges (children can't interconnect)
    - Top node is called root node (node without a parent)
    - Last node is called leaf node (node without a child)

    - Types:
        > Regular tree (parent-child relationship)
        > Binary tree (each node has <= 2 children)

    - Binary Search Tree (BST):
        Just like a binary tree but the values are in a specific way
            > left child has a less value than the parent
            > right child has a greater value than the parent
